# Student Schedule Codebase Reorganization

## What Has Been Done

✅ The codebase has been reorganized into a feature-based structure for better organization, maintainability, and scalability.

### New Structure

```
/src
  /features           
    /calendar         # Calendar feature
      /api            # Calendar API calls
      /components     # Calendar components
      /hooks          # Calendar hooks
      /types          # Calendar types
      /utils          # Calendar utilities
      index.ts        # Public exports
    /courses          # Courses feature
      /api            # Courses API
      /components     # Courses components
      /hooks          # Courses hooks
      /types          # Courses types
      index.ts        # Public exports
    /notes            # Notes feature  
      /api            # Notes API
      /components     # Notes components
      /hooks          # Notes hooks
      /types          # Notes types
      index.ts        # Public exports
  /shared             # Shared code
    /components       # Shared components
    /hooks            # Shared hooks
    /utils            # Shared utilities
    /types            # Shared types
    index.ts          # Public exports
  /pages              # Route components
  /components/ui      # UI components (unchanged)
  App.tsx             # Main app component
  main.tsx            # Entry point
```

### Completed Steps

1. ✅ Created the new directory structure
2. ✅ Installed dependencies (fixed Tailwind issues)
3. ✅ Copied all source files to their new locations
4. ✅ Updated TypeScript configuration with new path aliases
5. ✅ Updated import paths in key files
6. ✅ Created index files for feature modules

## How to Complete the Migration

We've created several files to help you complete the migration:

1. **`REORGANIZATION.md`** - Overview of the reorganization process
2. **`REORGANIZATION-STATUS.md`** - Current status and next steps 
3. **`complete-reorganization.ps1`** - Script that copied all files to new locations

### Next Steps for You

1. **Update Imports**: Continue updating import statements in files following the patterns in files we've already fixed:
   - Replace `@/components/calendar/...` with `@/features/calendar/components/...`
   - Replace `@/hooks/use-events` with `@/features/calendar/hooks/use-events`
   - See `REORGANIZATION-STATUS.md` for more patterns

2. **Test the Application**: Test thoroughly after updating imports
   - The development server is running, so you can test in real-time
   - Fix any issues that arise

3. **Clean Up**: Once everything works:
   - Remove duplicated files from their old locations
   - Remove temporary files like reorganization scripts

## Simplified Imports with Index Files

We've created index files to enable cleaner imports:

```tsx
// Instead of:
import { CalendarGrid } from '@/features/calendar/components/CalendarGrid';
import { CalendarHeader } from '@/features/calendar/components/CalendarHeader';

// You can use:
import { CalendarGrid, CalendarHeader } from '@/features/calendar';
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Check import paths carefully
- Ensure all feature directories have the necessary files
- Run `npm install` if you encounter additional dependency issues
- Make sure you're using the new path aliases defined in tsconfig.json
